    "q1": {
      "question": "How does the first consultation work?",
      "answer": "The first consultation is an introductory meeting of about 50 minutes where we discuss your needs and the goals you'd like to achieve. It's a moment to get to know each other and understand together if the path I propose is right for you. It involves no commitment."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How long is a session?",
      "answer": "Each session lasts about 50 minutes. The frequency of meetings is agreed upon together based on individual needs, generally on a weekly or bi-weekly basis."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What is the cost of sessions?",
      "answer": "The cost of sessions is communicated during the initial consultation. Fees are in line with the Order of Psychologists guidelines and invoices are tax-deductible."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Are online sessions available?",
      "answer": "Yes, I offer the possibility of online sessions via video call. Remote sessions are equally effective and allow you to continue your path even when you cannot come to the office."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How can I book an appointment?",
      "answer": "You can contact me through the form on the Contact page, via email, phone, or WhatsApp. I'll get back to you as soon as possible to schedule an initial meeting."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Are sessions confidential?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Professional secrecy is a fundamental ethical obligation. Everything shared during sessions is strictly confidential."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "What is the difference between a psychologist and a psychotherapist?",
      "answer": "A psychologist holds a master's degree in psychology and is registered with the professional board. They can provide consultations, psychological support, and assessments. A psychotherapist has also completed a four-year specialization school that qualifies them to treat more structured psychological disorders."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "How do I know if I need psychological support?",
      "answer": "If you feel that certain emotional, relational, or behavioral difficulties are interfering with your daily life, work, or relationships, it might be time to seek help. You don't need to wait until things get really bad — even talking to someone during a period of change can be helpful."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "Are sessions tax-deductible?",
      "answer": "Yes. Psychological services are tax-deductible healthcare expenses in Italy (19% deduction on the amount exceeding the €129.11 threshold). I issue regular invoices."
